# Network Policy API User Stories

This directory should be the entry point for any new object or feature proposed to the 
sig network policy api subgroup 

It is meant to house all user stories that have been reviewed and agreed upon by the sig for any new
k8's networking security object. 

The model should follow a standard github workflow, with a folder representing proposed new objects which
contains individual user stories that can be reviewed and commented on. To submit a new user story please 
open a PR roughly following the [template](#template) shown below. Each story should be in it's own markdown
file titled with a descriptive 3 word title:  `<Word1>_<Word2>_<Word3>.md, ...`

The following template should be used as a suggested guideline, please feel free to deviate and augment as needed. 

### Template

```markdown

### Summary 

A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

1. **As a** [user concerned by the story]
2. **I want** [goal of the story]
3. **so that** [reason for the story]

The “so that” part is optional if more details are provided in the description. 

### Description 

The user story should have a reason to exist: what do I need as the user described in the summary?
This part details any detail that could not be passed by the summary.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. [If I do A.]
2. [B should happen.]

[
Also, here are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. Constraint 1;
2. Constraint 2;
3. Constraint 3.
