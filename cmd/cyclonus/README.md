# NetworkPolicy Assistant (derived from Cyclonus)

(Work in Progress)

Explains your configuration of (Baseline)AdminNetworkPolicy and v1 NetworkPolicy. Additionally, can test conformance of (B)ANP and v1 NetworkPolicy via a connectivity matrix. Derived from the great work of @mattfenwick et al. in [Cyclonus](https://github.com/mattfenwick/cyclonus).

TODO: update README once [#150](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/network-policy-api/issues/150) is complete.
